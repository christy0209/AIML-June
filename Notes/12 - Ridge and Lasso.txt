Algorithm level techniques to avoid overfitting
	Regularization - used for linear models
	Ensemeble modelling - non linear models

What is Regularization - Regularization is a technique used for tuning the function by adding an additional penalty term in the error function.
	tuning  of function means minimizing the error and optimize m,c.

we already have coefficients in linear regression - m1,m2,m3- 
SE = sum([y-(m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c)]^2) (Normal Linear Regression)

along with this we will add one more term - penality term( adding this penality is known as Regularization)

Ridge Regression(L2 regularization) - we will add the square of coefficients as penalty - this wil shrink the weightage of each feature.
assume we have simple LR
in normal LR 
	Y = m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c
	SE = [y-(m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c)]^2
	We are introducing one more term - penality
	SE =  [y-(m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c)]^2 + L2*[m1^2+m2^2+m3^2]   L2- regularization factor/tuning parameter

	optimum value for m and c will change - you will get more accurate coefficents.

Lasso Regression(L1 regularization)
	instead of sqaure of coeff as penality, absolute value of coeff is added a penality
	Lasso can remove a feature by setting the coeeffiicient into 0

	Y = m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c
	SE = [y-(m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c)]^2
	We are introducing one more term - penality
	SE =  [y-(m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c)]^2 + L1*[|m1|+|m2|+|m3|]   L1- regularization factor/tuning parameter

Elastic Net  - combination of Ridge and Lasso
	SE =  [y-(m1x1+m2x2+m3x3+c)]^2 + L1*[|m1|+|m2|+|m3|] +L2*[m1^2+m2^2+m3^3]

Advanatages of Regularization

Prevents Overfitting: A high-dimensional dataset having too many features can sometimes lead to overfitting (model captures both real and random effects).

Simplicity: An over-complex model having too many features can be hard to interpret especially when features are correlated with each other.

Computational Efficiency: A model trained on a lower dimensional dataset is computationally efficient (execution of algorithm requires less computational time).

Regularization leads to dimensionality reduction, which means the machine learning model is built using a lower dimensional dataset. This generally leads to a high bias errror(under fitting)
