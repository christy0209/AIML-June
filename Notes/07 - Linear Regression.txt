Linear Regresison


This is an example for regression algorithm 
	means our output wil be continous.

Input variables	Output variable
Independenant	Dependant

The DV Y is continuous in nature..
Examples for such Y - 

	Salary
	Height
	Distane
	Price
	Time taken
	Speed

can u determine the salary of a person from his/her YoE,Age,Domain,Education? - 
this can be a machine lerning problem, supervised learning, regression

You have all the placement history of luminar.
So can you assume what salary you wil get once you got placed?


How Linear Regression works?

Linear regression works based on the equation of a line.
	Y = mX+c

	Y - dependent variable
	X - independent variable
	m - slope
	c -y intercept

multiple linear regresion
calculate salary wrto YoE(x1), Age(x2), Domain(x3), Education(x4)
salary(y)

	y = (m1x1+c1) + (m2x2+c2) + (m3x3+c3) + (m4x4+c4)
	y = m1x1 + m2x2 + m3x3 + m4x4 +.....+mnxn + C
	y = sigma(miXi)+C
