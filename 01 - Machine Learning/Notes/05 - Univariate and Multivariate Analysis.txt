Univariate Analysis - We are analysing one feature at a time.

Boxplot
A box plot (also known as box and whisker plot) is a type of chart often used in explanatory data analysis 
to visually show the distribution of numerical data and outlier through 
displaying the data quartiles (or percentiles) and averages

In statistics, correlation or dependence is any statistical relationship, 
whether causal or not, between two random variables or bivariate data. 
Correlation varies from -1 to 1.
