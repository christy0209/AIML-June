SMOTE

if the data is biased we have to implement some balancing mechanisms.
SMOTE - Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique 


true - 1000
false - 150 + 850 synthetic data will be created. this has to be only used for training- 
only the real data should be used for testing(no synthetic data used for testing)


there is a high bias(1000/1150) from class true- to avoid this SMOTE has to be implemented.

SMOTE is only for binary classification.

Cancer detection - positive wil be very less - 1-5%
fraud transaction -  1-5%
Such datasets are imbalanced

we need to balance the data

inbalanced means not-50:50, min 20% is required for 1 class. otherwise we need to use balancing techniques.


for installation
pip install imbalanced-learn
