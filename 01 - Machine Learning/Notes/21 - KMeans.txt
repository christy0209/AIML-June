Unsupervised Learning
	in Unsupervised Learning there wont be any labels(target) availble for training.
	It try to identify some intrinsic patterns from the data.
Eg: Clustering(KMeans),Dimensionality Reduction(Principal Component Analysis)

Clustering - Cluster analysis or clustering is the task of grouping a set of objects in such a way that 
objects in the same group are more similar to each other than to those in other groups.

Group - A set of similar objects - A group has homogenious nature. Between the groups objects are hetrogenious.

How clustering works in terms of ML :
Clustering is based on Eculedian Distance
	ED([x1y1],[x2y2]) = [x1-x2]^2 + [y1-y2]^2

Algorithms Used 
1.K-Means Algorithm
2.Hierarchical Clustering  (aglomerative clustering) - 1% use case
3.DBSCAN

in 90 - 95% of the cases, we will be using KMeans algorithm.

Hierarchical Clustering - sequential operation
	- Top to bottom
	- bottom to top
KMeans Clustering - parallel operation

K - #clusters - we have a technique to identify the best value for K - Elbow Method.

S1 - Identify the value for K - not part of modelling
S2 - Randomnly assign K centroids in the data.
S3 - Calculate Eucledian Distance for each data points from each centroids.
S4 - Assign the datapoints to the cluster with Minimum Eucledian Distance 
	Intra cluster distance should be as minimum as possible and inter cluster distance should be as max as possible
S5 - Recalculate the centroid for each clusters 
S6 - Repeat S3,S4 and S5 until saturation
S7 - list the clusters for each datapoints

Elbow Method

Elbow method used to idenify the best value for K
It uses KMeans algorithm itself to calculate the best value of K

Elbow graph is a plot, WCSS vs #clusters where WCSS - Within the Cluster sum of Square  = [ SUM of SQUARE(centroid - datapoint) ] 

if K =1 , WCSS will be Max
WCSS will reduce by increasing #K
if K = n , WCSS = 0
this graph will look like a human arm.
And the value at the elbow point is considered as the best value for K
