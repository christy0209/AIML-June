Just identify few things such as

What are the insights can be extracted from the data (EDA)
What are the preprocessing can done for better modelling




EDA (descriptive analytics - we can use every information) 

1- Which party has candidates with crimanal cases
2- party vs asset
3- age profiling of candidates
4- gender diversity
5- Election result summary (party vs number of seats won/ number of seats contested)
6- partywise voteshare
7- partywise performance in state level
8- what is the significance of Cases/Education in winning the election
9- Categorywise(cast) representation
10- Polling percentage analysis
11- Margin analysis



Preprocessing 

- null value removal
- convert ASSETS and LIABILITIES into numerical values
- remove candidates with less than 1-2 % total votes received
- remove NOTA
- Remove corelated columns(eg party and symbol)
- Handling Special Characters
- Remove vote collected related information before modelling
- CRIMINAL\nCASES is object, convert into numerical value
