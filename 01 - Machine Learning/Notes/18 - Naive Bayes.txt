Naive Bayes classifiers are a collection of classification algorithms based on Bayes’ Theorem. 
It is not a single algorithm but a family of algorithms where all of them share a common principle, 
i.e. every pair of features being classified is independent of each other.

The fundamental Naive Bayes assumption is that each feature makes an independent and equal contribution to the outcome.

We assume that no pair of features are dependent
Secondly, each feature is given the same weight(or importance). 
None of the attributes is irrelevant and assumed to be contributing equally to the outcome.

Bayes’ Theorem finds the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred

where A and B are events and P(B) ? 

Basically, we are trying to find probability of event A, given the event B is true. Event B is also termed as evidence.
P(A) is the priori of A (the prior probability, i.e. Probability of event before evidence is seen). 
The evidence is an attribute value of an unknown instance(here, it is event B).
P(A|B) is a posteriori probability of B, i.e. probability of event after evidence is seen.


X = (Rainy, Hot, High, False)
y = No

So basically, P(y|X) here means, the probability of “Not playing golf” given that the weather conditions are “Rainy outlook”, 
“Temperature is hot”, “high humidity” and “no wind”.

Now, its time to put a naive assumption to the Bayes’ theorem, 
which is, independence among the features. So now, we split evidence into the independent parts.
